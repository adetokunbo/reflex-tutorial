[Previously](../components/) we looked at TODO

## The list functions

- list and the full model
  - sample is fine here?
  
<div id="examples-collection-list"></div>

<div id="examples-collection-list-initial"></div>

<div id="examples-collection-eventwriter-1"></div>

<div id="examples-collection-eventwriter-2"></div>

<div id="examples-collection-eventwriter-3"></div>

- list and the minimal model

## `EventWriter`

- introduce eventwriter

- use eventwriter for the full model and for the minimal model

- use the ability to map over the w in an eventwriter to compose these things

## `DynamicWriter`

- look into using dynwriter to further clean things up

## Playing along at home

There are exercises [here](../exercises/collections/) that will put your understanding of the above content to the test.
These exercises build up incrementally as the series progresses, so it would probably best to start the exercises beginning at the start of the series.

## Next up

In the [next post](../eventwriter/) we'll look at how we can use a typeclass from `reflex` to make collection management easier.
