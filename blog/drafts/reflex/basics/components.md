[Previously](../switching/) we looked at how to alter the FRP network in response to `Event`s.

Now we have the pieces we need to have a discussion about the ins and out of how to break apart those FRP networks into components that we can easily reason about and reuse.

## TODO

## Playing along at home

There are exercises [here](../exercises/components/) that will put your understanding of the above content to the test.
These exercises build up incrementally as the series progresses, so it would probably best to start the exercises beginning at the start of the series.

## Next up

In the [next post](../collections/) we'll look at how to manage collections in `reflex`.
